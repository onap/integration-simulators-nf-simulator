Standalone PNF Simulator configuration for HTTPS communication with VES
------------------------

This directory contains files for secured PNF Simulator deployments, which will use certificates for HTTPS communication with VES.  

Currently, there are two ways for PNF Simulator to fetch certificates:
* Using AAF Certman 
* Using OOM CertService (CMPv2) 
    
Both ways are described in `certman` and `certservice` directories respectively
