Standalone VES client configuration for HTTPS communication with VES
------------------------

This directory contains files for secured VES client deployments, which will use certificates for HTTPS communication with VES.  

Currently, there are two ways for VES client to fetch certificates:
* Using AAF Certman 
* Using OOM CertService (CMPv2) 
    
Both ways are described in `certman` and `certservice` directories respectively
